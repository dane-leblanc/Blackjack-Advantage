### About the app

Believe it or not, I'm not much of a gambler. In fact, I'm fairly risk-averse when it comes to my finances. However, I have always loved strategy games and am fascinated by the thought of "beating" a game or even finding the "optimal" way to play it.

Amazingly, the most popular table game offered by casinos is actually _beatable_ without cheating, just by using your brain and the right strategy.

This app serves as a tool to practice the skill of card-counting in a casino-like situation (with six-decks of cards being played at once) without having to risk a penny.

My plan is to continue adding more features to the app as time goes on, but for the time being please check it out and have fun!
